# Project Rules

Please read this before working on a new branch. It's imperative that you follow these rules and instructions in order to avoid complications with the project. We need to communicate and work as a cohesive unit. It's ok if you mess up along the way, but it is also important that you respect these rules and your team.

## Instructions

- When given a task, please follow the instructions given for said task and do not work on other parts of the project, unless you specify 'what you are trying to do' and 'why you trying to do so' to the other group members before doing said changes.
- Try to refrain from moving, adding or removing files before you notify the other group members of 'why' you need to do such changes.
- More rules and instructions may come at a later stage, so try to follow the few that already exist.

### Thank you for following these guidelines and keep communicating with your team.

_Sincerely yours, SCRUM Master_
